Task 25: Reusable input box component

I have big plans for you. For that we need a reusable input box component.

This component should ask the user for either string or number input.
It should also have a label to explain what the user should input.

There should be functions hidden from the user that will handle the received value.
This could handled outside the input box itself, as in a parent component.

To showcase, you can add it to the frontpage and have two input boxes.
One for string input and one for number input.
Display the received value below both input boxes.

Feel free to add validation as you see fit.

You can make a container component to handle the state and functions if you want; that will display the two input boxes.
