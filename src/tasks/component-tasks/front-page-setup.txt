Task 24: Type Brew frontpage deserves a better look!

With all your work here, we should be able to display it in a much nicer way.

I will give you two options, or choose a new one yourself.
1. We will setup so it is easier to solve your tasks.
The frontpage will display the text of your current task, the examples to go through and your input and output.
This should help your screenshots and maybe make it easier to see the code.

2. We will setup to simply get an overview and simply display your tasks.
This one will be easier and probably much better to start with.

Task:
For this task we will focus on only the frontpage and move things to add pages and links eventually.
Update the frontpage with a nicer header and description of what Type Brew is.

For option 1:
Add a section that will display your current task. Try if you can import the text file and display it nicely.
Remember a title and description to explain what is happening here,
as well as good design so we know that this section is part of the task.

For option 2:
Then add a list of your tasks with links to each task page.
For each task, display the title, short description and how many examples you have.
You don't have to do all the tasks, we are just preparing.
