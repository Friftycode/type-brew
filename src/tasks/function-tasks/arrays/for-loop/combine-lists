Task 28: Combine lists

We will have a function that takes in three parameters: three lists of integers.

The function will return the first list, but with the second list added at the positions listed in the third list
If the second list is longer than the third list, the remaining elements of the second list will be added to the end of the first list.
If the third list is longer than the second list, the remaining positions will be ignored.

Examples:
insert_lists([1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [0, 2]) ➞ [4, 1, 2, 5, 3]
insert_lists([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [0, 2]) ➞ [4, 1, 2, 5, 3, 6]
insert_lists([1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [0, 2, 4]) ➞ [4, 1, 2, 5, 3]
