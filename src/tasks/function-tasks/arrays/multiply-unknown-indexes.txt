Task 23: Multiply unknown indexes

Create a function that takes in two lists of numbers.

For each index in the second list, multiply the numbers in the first list in that position. Return the result.

Examples:
- [2,5,1,6,2], [0,2,4] -> 4     //2*1*2
- [5,22,19,0,1], [1,2,3] -> 0   //22*19*0
- [1,2,3,4], [0,3] -> 4         //1*4
