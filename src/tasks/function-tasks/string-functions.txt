Task 11: String functions

Tip: String functions: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp

We will go through several small tasks to explore the different string functions.
Try to figure out yourself which one you need to use for each task.
Each task will require you to create one single function each and return the string or the specified value.

1. How long is the string?
    Examples:
    "12342" => 4
    "abc" => 3

2. I only want to know what month it is.
    From the api I get the date formatted like YYYY-MM-DD, but I only want the month part.
    Examples:
    2024-12-24 => 12
    1994-04-12 => 04

3. Where is the letter e and what character is in position 2?
    Examples:
    fireball => 3, r
    Parrapppaeee => 9, r
    eee => 0, e

4. Take in two strings, make the first one uppercase, second lowercase, return combined.
    Examples:
    yo, bebbeh => YObebbeh
    fire, ball => FIREball
