Task 27: Try catch an error.

We want to use the function from the previous task, but we want to handle the error gracefully.

Create a function that calls the function from the previous task inside a try block.
If an error is thrown, catch it and return a sensible message to the user.
Otherwise, return the length of the string in a message.

This function will also take in a parameter that can either be a string or undefined,
and then call the previous function with that parameter.
