Task 10: Array functions

Tip: Array functions: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp

We will go through several small tasks to explore the different array functions.
Try to figure out yourself which one you need to use for each task.
Each task will require you to create one single function each and return the values specified or the updated array.

1. Combine two arrays.
    Create one function that takes in two arrays. Return a combined array.
    Examples:
     [1,2,3], [4,5,6] -> [1,2,3,4,5,6]
     ['a', 'b'], ['c'] -> ['a', 'b', 'c']
     ['love'], [] -> ['love']
     [], [] -> []

2. Change out the last item in the array
    Create one function that takes in an array, and an item.
    First, remove the item at the end of the array.
    Second, add the received item to the end of the array.
    Examples:
    [1,2,3], 6 -> [1,2,6]
    ['a', 'b', 'c'], "def" -> ['a', 'b', "def"]
    [123, "yoyo"], ["fireball"] -> [123, ["fireball"]]

3. Print the length of the array, add an item, print the length again.
    Obviously, the second number printed will be one more than the first, because we added an item to the length.
    Choose yourself how you want to solve this regarding inputs.
    Examples:
    [1,2,3] => will print 3, 4
    [] => will print 0, 1

4. Flatten arrays
    Just that. Arrays within arrays? That's confusing, we don't want that.
    Examples:
    [2,3,[1,1,[3],1],4,5] -> [2,3,1,1,3,1,4,5]

5. Where did I put that again?
    Oh no! I seem to have forgotten where I put my item in this list, can you find the position for me?

    Examples:
    [1,2,3,4,5], 3 => 2
    [a,b,c,d,e,f,g], g => 6
    ["Oh", "Wow", "Yay"], "Oh" => 0
