Task 9: List of three

Tip: Arrays: https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_arrays.php

Create a single function that takes in three parameters, any type. Return a list including all three inputs.

Note: I do NOT want a string with the signs [ and ] in the beginning and end,
it should return a list type, not a string type.

Examples:
    - 1,2,3 => [1,2,3]
    - a,b,c => [a,b,c]
    - 28,yo,false => [28,yo,false]
    - undefined,0,hi => [undefined,0,hi]
