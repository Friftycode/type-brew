Task 22: Repeat the strings.

Create a function that takes in two arrays. One is strings and the other is numbers.

For each of the index print the string for that number of times. If either list is too long then return just the remainder.

Examples:
 - ["yo", "hi", "bye"], [1,2,3,4] -> [4]
 prints:
    yo
    hi
    hi
    bye
    bye
    bye

 - ["hello", "my","blep"], [0,3] -> ["blep"]
 prints:
    my
    my
    my
