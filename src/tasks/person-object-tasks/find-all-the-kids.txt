Task 16: Find all the kids

Write a function that takes in an array of person objects and returns an array of names of all the kids (people under 18 years old/attends school).
There will be several ways to solve this, feel free to use any method you prefer, as well as creating several functions if you want to test out different methods.

 Examples:
 - [{ name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' }, { name: 'Alice', age: 15, city: 'Los Angeles' }, { name: 'Bob', age: 10, city: 'Chicago' }] => ['Alice', 'Bob']
 - [{ name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' }, { name: 'Alice', age: 25, city: 'Los Angeles' }] => []
 - [{ name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' }, { name: 'Alice', age: 17, city: 'Los Angeles' }, { name: 'Bob', age: 18, city: 'Chicago' }] => ['Alice']
