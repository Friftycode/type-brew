Task 14: People interface

Tip: https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_aliases_and_interfaces.php

We will be using the person object from task 12 a lot, so let's create an interface for it.

No functions needed, just the interface for the person object.

Update the person functions from task 12 and 13 to use this interface.
