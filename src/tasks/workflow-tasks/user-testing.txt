Task 21: User testing

This is interesting, we will start this very simple. Pick one of your webpages and run it, have a user anyone you know, try to take a look at it and click through and see what they think.

Prepare a few questions you want to have answered throughout the testing.

Guidelines and tips:
- Start by learning the user group they fit into. Are they very tech savvy? Are they very young? Any disabilities?
- Don't say what to do or think, ask openly, let them figure out themselves.
- Don't react positively or negatively to actions, try not to react at all.
- Don't ask leading questions, it will persuade them to think a certain way is better and answer that.
- Do tell them to just say everything they're thinking. Take notes.
- Try to notice what they try to click on, what they don't try to click on. Why is that?
- Did they figure out the point of the webpage? Was it easy? Was it difficult? Why?
- Try to sort your thoughts in the answer.
- Try to ask them to do something. Can they change the username? Can they find the settings page? Can they order a book? (This all depends on what page you choose to test)

User testing is very important to do throughout the development phase, before, during and after.
You get to learn what the users need and are looking for as well as seeing if what you're creating is actually good or not.

This doesn't have to be big. Feel free to pick one of your one-page projects.

Have fun with it! This is a first try, doesn't have to be perfect.
Feel free to also look up templates for this, but I'd suggest to just wing it to try it out for now.
